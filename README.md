### `/Programming with Python`

Jupyter Notebooks that coincide with the [Programming in Python Software Carpentry lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).  

The folder `/Full Notebooks` are heavily annotated walk-throughs of the lesson with the code already completed.  

The folder `/Instructor Notebooks` contain less details but with no completed.  

Both sets of Notebooks can be used to walk through the lesson, but if you choose to use the the Notebooks in the `/Full Notebooks`
folder, I would encouge you to delete all the code prior to starting the lesson.  You could then follow the lesson on the Software 
Carpentry website or this GitHub page for reference.

### `/Version control with Git` 

Just the slides from my lesson.  The full lesson can be found at [the Software Carpentry website](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).


### Videos

I will post a link to the workshop video when they become available.  

### Contributing
