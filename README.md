[Workshop link](https://russodanielp.github.io/2019-02-15-rutgers_cmd/)  

Contact shende@camden.rutgers.edu, danrusso@scarletmail.rutgers.edu, or heather.ciallella@rutgers.edu with any questions.

### `/Programming with Python`

Jupyter Notebooks that coincide with the [Programming in Python Software Carpentry lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).  

The folder `/Full Notebooks` are heavily annotated walk-throughs of the lesson with the code already completed.  

The folder `/Instructor Notebooks` contain less details but with no completed.  

Both sets of Notebooks can be used to walk through the lesson, but if you choose to use the the Notebooks in the `/Full Notebooks`
folder, I would encouge you to delete all the code prior to starting the lesson.  You could then follow the lesson on the Software 
Carpentry website or this GitHub page for reference.

### `/Plotting and Programming with Python`

Jupyter Notebooks that coincide with the selection of episodes of the [Plotting and Programming with Python Software Carpentry lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) covered in the workshop.

The folder `/Full Notebooks` are heavily annotated walk-throughs of the lesson with the code already completed.  

The folder `/Instructor Notebooks` contain less details but with no completed.

### `/Version control with Git` 

This folder just houses the slides from the lesson.  The full lesson can be found at [the Software Carpentry website](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
